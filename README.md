# dcurl - Multi-threaded Curl implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DLTcollab/dcurl.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/DLTcollab/dcurl)
![Supported IRI version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported%20IRI%20Version-1.6.0-brightgreen.svg)

Hardware-accelerated implementation for IOTA PearlDiver, which utilizes multi-threaded SIMD, FPGA and GPU.

# Introduction
dcurl exploits SIMD instructions on CPU and OpenCL on GPU. Both CPU and GPU accelerations can be
enabled in multi-threaded execuction fashion, resulting in much faster proof-of-work (PoW) for IOTA
Reference Implementation (IRI). Additionally, dcurl also supports the FPGA-accelerated solution further described in docs/fpga-accelerator.md

# Warning
* You need to configure paths and flags of OpenCL installation in ```mk/opencl.mk```
* dcurl will automatically configure all the GPU divices on your platform.
* Check JDK installation and set JAVA_HOME if you wish to specify.
* If your platform doesn't support Intel SSE, dcurl would be compiled with naive implementation.
* For the IOTA hardware accelerator, we integrate [Lampa Lab's Cyclone V FPGA PoW](https://github.com/LampaLab/iota_fpga) into dcurl. Lampa Lab provides soc_system.rbf only for DE10-nano board. You need to synthesize to get soc_system.rbf for using Arrow SoCKit board and [this RBF file](https://github.com/ajblane/dcurl/releases/tag/v1.0-SoCKit) can be downloaded from our release. Moreover, you need to download [Lampa Lab-provided Linux image](https://github.com/LampaLab/iota_fpga/releases/tag/v0.1) to flash into the micro-SD card and root password is 123456. Finally, you also need to download dcurl into root directory.

# Build Instructions
* dcurl allows various combinations of build configurations to fit final use scenarios.
* You can execute `make config` and then edit file `build/local.mk` for custom build options.
    - ``BUILD_AVX``: build Intel AVX-accelerated Curl backend.
    - ``BUILD_GPU``: build OpenCL-based GPU accelerations.
    - ``BUILD_JNI``: build a shared library for IRI. The build system would generate JNI header file
                     downloading from [latest JAVA source](https://github.com/DLTcollab/iri).
    - ``BUILD_COMPAT``: build extra cCurl compatible interface.
    - ``BUILD_FPGA_ACCEL``: build the interface interacting with the Cyclone V FPGA based accelerator. Verified on DE10-nano board and Arrow SoCKit board.
    - ``BUILD_STAT``: show the statistics of the PoW information.
* Alternatively, you can specify conditional build as following:
```shell
$ make BUILD_GPU=0 BUILD_JNI=1 BUILD_AVX=1
```

# Test
* Test with GPU
```shell
$ make BUILD_GPU=1 check
```

# Tweaks
* Number of threads to find nonce in CPU
    * ```$ export DCURL_NUM_CPU=26```

# Performance
After integrating dcurl into IRI, performance of <```attachToTangle```> is measured as following.
* Each sampling is measured with 30 transaction trytes and total 200 samples are measured.
* mwm = 14, 26 CPU threads to find nonce
* Settings: enable 2 pow tasks in CPU, 1 pow tasks in GPU at the same time
